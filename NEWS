    Applied Dave Dodge's patch (but renamed the levels). He writes:

This patch against netwalk-0.4.6 adds several features:

  - A new "Giant" difficulty level with a 50x50 arena.

  - A new "Absurd" difficulty level with a 50x50 wrapped arena.

  - The high score window now computes its height instead of
    using fixed values, so that it can adapt to the number of
    difficulty levels.

  - The middle mouse button toggles marking of a cell.  A marked
    cell simply renders with a different background color.  This makes
    it practical to play very large arenas, because you can (for example)
    mark the cells that you know are have the correct orientation.

  - When working with a wrapped arena and pointing the mouse at an edge
    cell, the corresponding cells on the opposite edges will have
    a very light highlight applied to their border.  This makes it
    practical to play very large wrapped arenas.

    Allowed key repeating (to aid textbox editing).

    [netwalk-0.4.6.tgz]

Fri Aug  6 13:01:45 PDT 2004
    Implemented suggestions from Denis Klykvin: now loads config file
    from $HOME/.netwalk/ and if it doesn't exist, a default one will be
    created.

    Updated outdated README.

    [netwalk-0.4.5.tgz]

Sun Jun 27 10:41:49 PDT 2004
    Minor Makefile cleanup.

Tue Jun 22 23:13:04 PDT 2004
    Interface is better: shading of widgets, current menu item is highlighted,
    menu item is activated on mouse button up, rather than a second click.
    Split program into a few files.

    Menu drawing code was inefficient.

    Bugfix in in_widget().

    Rearranged "Enter name" window.

    Makefile generates version.h.

    Added comments to beginning of all source files.

    More bugfixes (related to shift key handling).

Mon Mar 17 15:19:50 PST 2003
    Just realized it crashes on my XP laptop.
    After some code cleanup, the bug mysteriously disappeared.

    Released first C version.

Thu Jan  9 19:39:21 PST 2003
    Forgot to remove one hardcoded colour (0xffffff for the pulse colour).

Wed Jan  8 23:50:44 PST 2003
    Added "showmoves" configuration option.

Mon Jan  6 11:36:14 PST 2003
    Added high scores. Code is very crufty now, will cleanup after release.

Mon Jan  6 13:18:52 PST 2003
    Handles SDL_Quit event, doesn't try to initialize audio.

Sun Jan  2 22:23:14 PST 2003
    Added no_fourway option.

Wed Jan  1 00:19:28 PST 2003
    More kludges: widget->localx and localy store relative coordinates,
    call widget->computexy() to compute screen coordinates. Submenu items
    locations are computed on the fly.

    Added menu items to change difficulty level, resizes window automatically.

Mon Dec 30 11:40:27 PST 2002
    Displays elapsed time.

Wed Dec 25 10:35:55 PST 2002
    Cleaned up colour code. (Eliminated many SDL_MapRGB()'s)

Sun Nov 17 13:16:31 PST 2002
    GUI pretty boring. I pick at it every now and then.
    Got around to implementing wrap.

Fri Nov  8 17:39:28 PST 2002
    Confused about implementing menus. Code is terrible, but it works.

    Started GUI. Doing OOP in C.

Thu Nov  7 10:56:02 PST 2002
    Added animation when you win.

Thu Nov  7 00:15:07 PST 2002
    Restarted project in C. I'm in an anti-OOP phase.
    Playable, but missing a few features from my Eiffel version, notably
    the GUI.
